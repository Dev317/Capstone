# Capstone

This repository will be used for capstone project!

The capstone project is about finding out which location to open a healthy drink store (soyabean drinks) in the city of Hanoi.

By using KNN algorithm, it was possible to cluster districts with common activities. This will help owners to decide which district to place the store with knowledge about the habits of the district's residents.
